## Using Custom Benchmarks

When user provides custom benchmarks:

2. **Override defaults** for specified campaign types
3. **Note in report** which benchmarks are custom vs. default
4. **Flag significant deviations** from both custom and industry standards

### Collecting Custom Benchmarks

Ask user:
> "Do you have specific CTR or performance targets for this client? If so, please provide:
> - Search CTR target: ____%
> - Display CTR target: ____%
> - Target CPA: $____
> - Any other specific KPIs: ____"

If user declines or doesn't have custom targets, proceed with industry defaults.
